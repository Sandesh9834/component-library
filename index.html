            <p>Component libraries form the foundation of the organization's frontend apps. They must be flexible to provide a proper solution to a wide range of predicted and unpredicted use cases.
                  To achieve that flexibility, build your library as a modular system, where each of its components is published individually as a single package. This will allow consumers of that library to pick and choose the components and component versions they need. It will provide them with a tailor-made solution and decrease the likelihood of new updates breaking their projects or modifying their UI/UX in unwanted ways.</p>
